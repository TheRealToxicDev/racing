	Checkpoint Parsing
	
	Take the checkpoint data from UGC.mission.race and turn it into our own custom type to distribute to clients on our terms.

	Data relevant to checkpoints (located at #.mission.race)
		"chh": [], 			// CHeckpoint Heading (for spawns)
		"chl": [], 			// CHeckpoint Location
		"chp": 33, 			// number of CHeckPoints
		"chs": [], 			// CHeckpoint Scale
		"chs2": [], 		// CHeckpoint Scale (for the second checkpoint)
		"cpado": [],		// CheckPoint ADO?: the x and z components make their way to y and z rotation floats of _GET_VEHICLE_SUSPENSION_BOUNDS in one case. not sure what it actually is for though
		"cpados": [],		// CheckPoint ADO? (for the Second checkpoint)
		"cpbs1": [],		// CheckPoint BitSet 1: ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
		"cpbs2": [],		// CheckPoint BitSet 2: ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
		"cpdss": [],		// no clue :(
		"cpgrav": [], 		// CheckPoint GRAVity?: unused
		"cpgravdura": [],	// CheckPoint GRAVity? DURAtion: unused
		"cppsst": [],		// CheckPoint S?S? Time:
		"cprst": [],		// CheckPoint ReSet Time: (assumed from other data)
		"cpwwt": [],		// CheckPoint Wrong Way Time: default is 7500 when the value is either -1 or 0, otherwise it is the value * 1000 (compared to game timer)
		"sndchk": [],		// SecoND CHecKpoint: the location of the second checkpoint in a checkpoint pair (from looking at decompiled scripts, not actually tested) 
		"sndrsp": [],		// SecoND ReSPawn heading?: a float related to the heading where you should respawn from (as decompiled scripts point towards chh or this depending on a boolean.)
		"cpair": [], 		// is Checkpoint PAIR: if this checkpoint has a pair to it
		"rndchk": [],		// Round CHecKpoint: if this is true, the checkpoint is a round one (for tubes and stuff)
		"rndchks": [],		// Round CHecKpoint (for the Second checkpoint): same as above for the second checkpoint in a pair
		/// If an index in any of the following is a zero vector, the try the next set, if all sets have zero vectors,
		/// go back one the chain and repeat until the first checkpoint in which case, start at the beginning of the race there.
		/// I believe that's how it goes anyways...
		"vspn0": [],		// Vehicle SPawN 0: The first point to try to respawn the player when they retry from checkpoint
		"vspn1": [],		// Vehicle SPawN 1: The second point to respawn at (if the first is occupied?)
		"vspn2": [],		// Vehicle SPawN 2: The third point to respawn at (if the second is occupied?)

		"vspns0": [],		// Vehicle SPawN (Second checkpoint) 0: same as above for the second checkpoint in a pair
		"vspns1": [],		// Vehicle SPawN (Second checkpoint) 1: ...
		"vspns2": [],		// Vehicle SPawN (Second checkpoint) 2: ...
